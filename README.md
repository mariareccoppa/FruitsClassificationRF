# Classifying Fruits Using RandomForestClassifier
This project demonstrates the application of a RandomForestClassifier to classify fruits. The model is trained to identify various fruits based on features such as mass, width, height, and color score.

## Project Overview
The pipeline is built using Python and incorporates several key libraries:
* Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
* Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks

It includes the following steps:
* Loading and preprocessing the data using Pandas
* Splitting the data into training and test sets
* Training a RandomForestClassifier to distinguish between different fruit types
* Building and evaluating a RandomForestClassifier model using a confusion matrix

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is fruit_data_with_colors.txt, which contains the mass, width, height, and color score of different fruits to accurately identify them. The data is split into 80% for training and 20% for testing.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the RandomForestClassifier is visualized through a confusion matrix, indicating the model's accuracy in classifying the fruits.
