# FruitsClassificationRF

In this Python project, I classified four different kinds of fruits based on their mass, width, height, and color score. A RandomForestClassifier was used to predict what fruit it was. The data was divided 80% for training and 20% for testing. The model's performance was assessed using accuracy, cross validation and a confusion matrix.
